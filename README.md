# ez-vcard-android

Maps the Android vCard API to the [ez-vcard](http://github.com/mangstadt/ez-vcard) API.

Converts an [ez-vcard](http://github.com/mangstadt/ez-vcard) `VCard` object into the appropriate Android data fields, so it can be added to an Android user's contact list.

#Code Sample

```java
File vcardFile = ...
VCardReader reader = null;
try {
  reader = new VCardReader(vcardFile);
  reader.registerScribe(new AndroidCustomFieldScribe());

  ContactOperations operations = new ContactOperations(getApplicationContext());
  VCard vcard = null;
  while ((vcard = reader.readNext()) != null) {
      operations.insertContact(vcard);
  }
} finally {
  reader.close();
}
```
